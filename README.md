Pomodoro Timer App
This Pomodoro Timer app helps you manage your tasks effectively using the Pomodoro technique. The app allows you to choose the number of tasks, estimate the time each task will take, and then schedules work sessions with breaks accordingly. You work in focused intervals (usually 25 minutes), followed by short breaks, and after every 4 work sessions, you get a longer break.
